My research interests: My academic interest lies in modelling disease pathology through integrative multi-omics approaches. In particular, I’m enthusiastic about using bioinformatics and machine learning to understand aging-related diseases and psychiatric illnesses, especially using multi-omics data like epigenomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics.
