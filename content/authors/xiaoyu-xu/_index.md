My research is centered on renal cell carcinoma, focusing on disease diagnosis and drug resistance analysis. This involves the discovery of liquid biomarkers and the imaging analysis of histological sections from renal carcinoma tissues. A key future direction is the development of algorithms based on MALDI imaging annotation, aiming to provide innovative tools for exploring targeted interventions in patient drug resistance.
