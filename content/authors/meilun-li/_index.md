The rapid growth of microbiome and multi-omics data driven by advances in sequencing technologies poses significant challenges in data integration, analysis, and visualization. I am particularly interested in method-oriented projects like tidymicrobiome, which aim to build flexible and extensible analysis pipelines based on tidyverse principles, improving the accessibility, reproducibility, and interpretability of microbiome research.
