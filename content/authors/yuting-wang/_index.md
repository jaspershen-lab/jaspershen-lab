My research focuses on leveraging cutting-edge multi-omics technologies and machine learning approaches to capture the molecular features and dynamic trajectories of human aging and age-related diseases. I am also interested in developing bioinformatics tools to address current gaps in omics data analysis, with a particular emphasis on metabolomics.
