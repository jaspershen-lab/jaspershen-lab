My work integrates biology, chemistry, and computational science to advance precision medicine. Leveraging multi-omics data, I develop AI-driven models to dissect complex biological systems and identify disease mechanisms. Concurrently, I employ generative chemistry, virtual screening, and structure-based design to explore vast chemical spaces for novel therapeutics. By bridging multi-omics insights with computational drug discovery, my research aims to accelerate the development of personalized therapies, targeting unmet medical needs in oncology, neurodegeneration, and beyond. This interdisciplinary synergy—spanning systems biology, cheminformatics, and machine learning—strives to translate biological discoveries into clinically actionable solutions. (。・_・)ﾉ💊
